# ðŸš€ Naive Bayes Projects

This repository contains **two exciting machine learning projects** using **Naive Bayes classifiers**:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   - Uses **Gaussian Naive Bayes**  
   - Predicts survival of Titanic passengers based on features like age, sex, and passenger class.

2. **Spam Message Detection**  
   - Uses **Multinomial Naive Bayes**  
   - Classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham**.
